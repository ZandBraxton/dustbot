Dustbot is a discord bot that displays various character data from a wide variety of fighting games hosted at <a href="https://www.dustloop.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">Dustloop.</a>

Using slash commands you can bring up the list of supported games and navigate from there, or even search directly using discord's autocomplete function

The bot will display different data that was acquired from Dustloop, the data will differ from game to game as well.

Note that due to the constant updating nature of dustloop, in some cases the data may be inaccurate or images may not load. I will do my best to keep the bot as up to date as possible.
